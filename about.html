                <p>Hello reader, my name is E. Leon.
                    I am currently a college student who is pursing a career in Information Technology and CyberSecurity.
                    This website is a small portfolio of mine to showcase some of my skills and projects and as a way to showcase myself.
                    If you are interested in making a website for yourself feel free to explore for ideas, or even consider contacting me
                    to build you a small website of your own.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I have had experience working with React.js, Node.js, and a bit of Express as well.
                    I have worked minimally with APIs, and using databases such as MongoDB.
